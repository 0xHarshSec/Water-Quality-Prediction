# Water-Quality-Prediction

Water is our daily need, and knowing whether the water Quality is good or not is important. 
As low water Quality results in pollution and affects health. 
This paper is related to Water Quality Detection using Machine Learning algorithms by taking some inputs from users, it gives a solution for water quality detection automatically. By this, we will be able to identify whether the water quality is potable or not i.e., drinkable or not. We will be identifying different types of substances dissolved in water. Through manual inputs and the amount, there are present in water, we determine the Water Quality. This can be done using machine learning algorithms and various concepts related to it. Different types of algorithms can be used for the development of this type of model. We have done a survey in small areas regarding issues related to water quality that are faced by people regarding water cleanliness. 
The output helped us predict if the water is safe to drink or not and how to further improve the model.

Accuracy

Drawbacks and Future Scope:

Through this study, we have developed a machine learning algorithm to predict water quality. By collecting the data from the user, we predict is the water safe to drink. This will be a very helpful project because water is a crucial source of life and depending upon its quality it is used in various industries. Although we got an accuracy of an average of 66.59% and can further be improved by using more high-quality and unbiased data as we can see the dataset has more non-potable water data which makes this model slightly biased. Further, we can add more parameters to the model to predict the quality of water more accurately and also can tell whether to how many degrees the water can be used for commercial or household purposes.
